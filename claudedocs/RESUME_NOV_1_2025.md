## 💡 CONTEXT REMINDERS

**Week 1 Goal** (from roadmap):
- **Deliverable**: Users can create invoices and send campaigns through UI
- **Success Metric**: Invoice → Campaign → Send flow works end-to-end
- **Timeline**: Nov 1-7, 2025 (Week 1 of 7-week plan)

**Why Manual Testing**:
- APIs proven working (Oct 17 tests + Oct 31 inventory)
- Just need to verify UI calls APIs correctly
- Faster than fixing auth for automated tests
- More comprehensive than endpoint testing

**Expected Outcome**:
- Most flows likely work (backend is solid)
