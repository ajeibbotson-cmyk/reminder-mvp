# PDF Attachment Feature - Session Summary

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Feature**: Invoice PDF Attachments for Reminder Emails
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE AND TESTED**

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive PDF attachment support for invoice reminder emails. This feature enables automated delivery of invoice PDFs alongside payment reminder emails, addressing a core user requirement and justifying the AWS S3 integration.

## User Request

> "ok, in the past we have spoken about the reminder emails having the individual invoices attached, for a customers reference. This is integral, or atleast the option to add the invoices. Is this a possiblility? I think this is why we added amazon s3?"

**User Confirmation**: "yes please" to proceed with implementation
**Test Request**: "can you send me a test please"
**Test Result**: "Received and it was fantastic" ✅

## Implementation Summary

### Core Features Delivered

1. **AWS S3 PDF Retrieval**
   - Streaming download from S3 buckets
   - Buffer conversion for email encoding
   - Error handling with graceful fallback

2. **MIME Multipart Email Encoding**
   - RFC-compliant email structure
   - Base64 PDF encoding for transmission
   - HTML body + PDF attachment in single email

3. **Configurable Attachment System**
   - Per-campaign attachment settings
   - Database field: `attach_invoice_pdf` (defaults true)
   - Automatic fallback to no-attachment mode

4. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Continues without attachment if PDF unavailable
   - Logs warnings for debugging
   - No email delivery failures

### Technical Implementation

#### Files Modified

**`/src/lib/services/unifiedEmailService.ts`** - Core email service
- Added S3Client initialization
- Implemented `fetchPdfFromS3()` method
- Created `buildMimeEmailWithAttachment()` for MIME encoding
- Updated `sendSingleEmail()` to support attachments
- Added attachment configuration to schema
- Fixed email validation (denormalized fields)
- Fixed merge tag resolution

**`/prisma/schema.prisma`** - Database schema
```prisma
model invoiceCampaign {
  // ... existing fields ...
  attach_invoice_pdf      Boolean  @default(true)
}
```

**`/src/lib/services/bucket-auto-send-service.ts`** - Auto-send integration
- Enabled PDF attachments by default for auto-send campaigns

**`/claudedocs/pdf-attachment-implementation.md`** - Technical documentation

   - Convert S3 response streams to buffers
   - Memory-efficient for large PDFs
   - Error handling at stream level

3. **Default Attachment Enabled**
   - `attach_invoice_pdf: true` by default
   - Backward compatible with existing campaigns
   - User can opt-out per campaign

4. **Graceful Fallback**
   - No email failures if PDF unavailable
   - Logging for debugging
   - Maintains email delivery reliability

### Testing Results

#### Real Email Test
- **Sent From**: hello@usereminder.com
- **Sent To**: ajeibbotson@gmail.com
- **Region**: US-EAST-1
- **PDF Attached**: invoice-V01250703.pdf
- **SES Message ID**: 0100019a002b95f7-e9722058-44d1-4c9d-9c36-cae789bd1b65-000000
- **User Feedback**: "Received and it was fantastic" ✅

### Bug Fixes Applied

#### 1. Email Validation Error
**Issue**: Campaign creation validated 0 emails despite invoices having email addresses

**Root Cause**: Code checking `invoice.customer?.email` (relation) instead of `invoice.customer_email` (denormalized field)

**Fix**: Updated to use denormalized fields throughout
```typescript
// Before
const email = invoice.customer?.email?.toLowerCase()

// After
const email = invoice.customer_email?.toLowerCase()
```

**Locations Fixed**:
- Line 542: Email validation
- Lines 232, 237: Campaign creation
- Lines 680, 695, 700: Merge tag resolution

#### 2. AWS SES Region Mismatch
**Issue**: Email sending failed - emails not verified in ME-SOUTH-1

**Root Cause**: Emails verified in US-EAST-1, code attempting ME-SOUTH-1

**User Feedback**: "both of those emails are verified"

**Fix**: Changed region to US-EAST-1
```typescript
// Before
awsRegion: 'me-south-1'

// After
awsRegion: 'us-east-1' // Region where emails are verified
```

**Strategic Decision**: User confirmed staying on US-EAST-1 for all features

#### 3. Zod Validation Error
**Issue**: `delayBetweenBatches` validation error (expected >=1000)

**Fix**: Changed delay from 0ms to 1000ms minimum

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# AWS S3 (PDF Storage)

# AWS SES (Email Delivery)
AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
AWS_SES_FROM_EMAIL="hello@usereminder.com"
```

#### Campaign Options
```typescript
{
  sendingOptions: {
    attachInvoicePdf: true  // Enable/disable PDF attachments
  }
}
```

#### Auto-Send Configuration

// Bucket auto-send enables attachments by default
sendingOptions: {
  respectBusinessHours: true,
  batchSize: 5,
  delayBetweenBatches: 3000,
  attachInvoicePdf: true  // DEFAULT: Always attach PDFs
}
```

- **Batch Processing**: 5 emails per batch, 3s delay

### S3 Operations
- **Streaming Downloads**: Memory-efficient
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback
- **Caching**: Consider adding S3 response caching

### Database Impact
- **New Field**: `attach_invoice_pdf` Boolean (minimal storage)
- **Query Performance**: No additional joins required
- **Index Coverage**: Existing indexes sufficient

## Security & Compliance
