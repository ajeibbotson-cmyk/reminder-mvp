# Reminder - Product Definition

**Last Updated**: November 10, 2025

## What Reminder IS

**Reminder is an invoice chasing platform.**

SMEs upload their invoices → Reminder chases payment → Invoices get paid faster.

## What Reminder is NOT

❌ **NOT an invoicing tool** (we don't compete with QuickBooks, Xero, FreshBooks)
❌ **NOT an accounting system** (we don't do bookkeeping)
❌ **NOT an invoice creation platform** (customers already have invoices)

## Core Value Proposition

**Problem**: SMEs waste 2.5 hours manually chasing late payments
**Solution**: Upload invoices, we automate the chasing
**Result**: Get paid faster with 10 minutes of work instead of 2.5 hours

## How It Works

### 1. Upload Your Invoices (3 Ways)

**PDF Upload** (Primary)
- Drag & drop PDF invoices
- AI extracts all data automatically (93% accuracy)
- Review and confirm
- Done

**CSV/Excel Import**
- Upload spreadsheet with invoice data
- Map columns to fields
- Import batch
- Done

**Future: Accounting Integration**
- Connect QuickBooks/Xero
- Auto-sync invoices
- Zero manual work

### 2. Automatic Chasing

**Bucket System**
- Invoices automatically categorized by age
- Week 1: Gentle reminder
- Week 2: Follow-up
- Week 3: Firm reminder
- Week 4+: Final notice

**Smart Automation**

- Professional email templates
- PDF invoice attachments
- Reply-To configuration

### 3. Get Paid Faster

**Payment Tracking**

**Analytics**
