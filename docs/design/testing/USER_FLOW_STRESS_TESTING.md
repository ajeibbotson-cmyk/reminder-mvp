## üß™ Test Category 2: Bulk Import Workflow

### Test 2.1: 50 Invoice Batch Processing
**Scenario**: Simulate user uploading 50 invoices from 10 companies

**Test Data Creation**:
```bash
# Create test data script
node scripts/generate-test-invoice-batch.js --invoices 50 --companies 10
```

**Test Steps**:
1. **Upload Batch**: Upload file with 50 invoices
2. **Pre-Import Analysis**: Validate customer matching suggestions

- User intervention: <20% of invoices require manual attention

### Test 2.2: Second Batch Processing (Learning Test)
**Scenario**: Upload second batch from same 10 companies after 2 days

**Test Steps**:
1. **Upload Second Batch**: Same companies, different invoices
2. **Pattern Recognition**: System should recognize existing customers
3. **Auto-Approval Rate**: Measure how many invoices auto-approve based on learned patterns

**Success Criteria**:
- Customer recognition: 100% accuracy for existing customers
- Auto-approval rate: >80% for invoices matching learned patterns

### Test 2.3: Duplicate Detection
**Scenario**: Upload file containing duplicate invoices

**Test Data**:
- 5 completely identical invoices
- 5 invoices with same number but different amounts
- 5 invoices with similar but not identical data

**Success Criteria**:
- 100% detection of exact duplicates
- Clear user interface for handling similar invoices
- No database constraint errors

## üß™ Test Category 3: CRM & Dashboard Performance

### Test 3.1: Dashboard Load Performance
**Scenario**: Test dashboard with 100+ invoices and 10+ customers

**Test Setup**:
```sql
-- Seed database with test data
INSERT INTO customers (name, email, company_id) VALUES
  ('Above The Clouds', 'info@atc.com', 'test_company'),
  -- ... 9 more customers

INSERT INTO invoices (number, customer_email, amount, company_id) VALUES
  ('INV001', 'info@atc.com', 7978.00, 'test_company'),
  -- ... 99 more invoices
```

**Performance Criteria**:
- Dashboard load time: <3 seconds
- Customer list rendering: <2 seconds
- Invoice table scrolling: Smooth with virtual scrolling
- Filter/search response: <500ms

### Test 3.2: Customer Relationship View
**Scenario**: Test customer view with multiple invoices

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to customer detail page
2. View customer with 10+ invoices
3. Test bulk actions (select multiple invoices)
4. Test payment allocation interface

**Success Criteria**:
- Customer overview loads: <2 seconds
- All invoices visible in organized list
- Bulk selection works smoothly
- Outstanding balance calculations accurate

---

## üß™ Test Category 4: Payment Management Testing

### Test 4.1: Bulk Payment Allocation
**Scenario**: Customer pays ‚Ç¨25,000 covering multiple invoices

**Test Setup**:
- Customer: Above The Clouds
- Outstanding invoices: ‚Ç¨7,978 + ‚Ç¨8,900 + ‚Ç¨22,622.60 = ‚Ç¨39,500.60
- Payment: ‚Ç¨25,000

**Test Steps**:
1. **Record Payment**: Enter ‚Ç¨25,000 payment
2. **Smart Allocation**: System suggests allocation across invoices
3. **Manual Adjustment**: User can modify allocation
4. **Apply Payment**: Process allocation and update statuses

**Success Criteria**:
- Allocation suggestions accurate (oldest first)
- Partial payment handling correct
- Invoice statuses update properly (2 PAID, 1 PARTIALLY_PAID)
- Customer outstanding balance updates: ‚Ç¨39,500.60 - ‚Ç¨25,000 = ‚Ç¨14,500.60

### Test 4.2: Payment Workflow Edge Cases
**Test Scenarios**:
- Overpayment (customer pays more than owed)
- Underpayment (payment doesn't cover full invoices)
- Multiple payments on same day
- Payment for already paid invoice
