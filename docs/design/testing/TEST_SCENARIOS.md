# Real-World Test Scenarios

## ðŸŽ¯ Critical Test Scenarios for Bulk Invoice Processing

### Scenario 1: Initial Bulk Import (50 Invoices, 10 Companies)
**Business Context**: New customer brings historical invoices for processing

**Test Data**:
```bash
node scripts/generate-test-invoice-batch.js --invoices 50 --companies 10
```

**Key Challenges**:
- Mixed invoice ages (some 90+ days overdue)
- Different currencies (AED, EUR, USD)
- Various payment statuses (paid, partial, unpaid)
- Customer name variations requiring fuzzy matching

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Pre-import analysis identifies 15 critical overdue invoices
- Customer matching suggests consolidation of similar company names
- System prioritizes oldest unpaid invoices for follow-up
- Dashboard shows clear impact of import on metrics

### Scenario 2: Follow-up Batch (Same Companies, New Invoices)
**Business Context**: 2 days later, same companies submit more invoices

**Test Setup**:
- Same 10 companies from Scenario 1
- 50 new invoices with different invoice numbers
- Some customers have made payments on previous invoices

**Expected Outcomes**:
- 100% customer recognition (no new customer creation)
- 80%+ auto-approval rate based on learned patterns
- Processing time reduced by 70%+ compared to first batch
- Consolidated customer views show complete invoice history

### Scenario 3: Payment Allocation Stress Test
**Business Context**: Multiple customers make bulk payments

**Test Cases**:
1. **Above The Clouds**: â‚¬25,000 payment covering 3 invoices
2. **Dubai Tech Solutions**: AED 45,000 covering 5 invoices with overpayment
3. **Emirates Marketing**: USD 18,500 partial payment across multiple invoices

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Smart allocation suggestions match oldest-first strategy
- Partial payments handled correctly
- Invoice statuses update properly (PAID/PARTIALLY_PAID)
- Customer outstanding balances calculate accurately

### Scenario 4: Dashboard Performance Under Load
**Business Context**: Dashboard with 100+ invoices, 10+ customers

**Performance Benchmarks**:
- Initial dashboard load: <3 seconds
- Customer filter/search: <500ms
- Invoice table scrolling: Smooth virtual scrolling
- Metric calculations: Real-time updates

**Load Conditions**:
- 150 invoices across 15 customers
- Mixed currencies and statuses
- Historical data spanning 6 months
- Multiple concurrent users

### Scenario 5: Error Recovery & Edge Cases
**Business Context**: Handle system failures gracefully

**Test Cases**:
1. **Network interruption** during PDF processing
2. **Database constraint violation** (duplicate invoice attempt)
3. **AWS Textract service unavailable** (fallback to pdf-parse)
4. **Malformed PDF** (corrupted or unsupported format)
5. **User session timeout** during reconciliation

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Graceful fallback mechanisms activate
- User receives clear error messages and recovery options
- Partial progress is saved and resumable
- Data integrity maintained under all failure conditions

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Testing Pipeline

### Automated Validation
```javascript
// Example test automation
const testPipeline = {
  // Daily automated tests
  daily: [
    'pdf-extraction-accuracy',
    'dashboard-performance',
    'basic-workflow-validation'
  ],

  // Weekly comprehensive tests
  weekly: [
    'bulk-import-stress-test',
    'payment-allocation-scenarios',
    'error-recovery-simulation'
  ],

  // Pre-deployment critical tests
  preDeployment: [
    'full-user-workflow',
    'data-integrity-validation',
    'performance-benchmark-comparison'
  ]
};
```

### Real-World Validation
- Test with actual customer PDF files
- Validate with real payment scenarios
- User acceptance testing with target audience
- Performance monitoring in production environment

### Regression Prevention
- Automated test suite runs on every code change
