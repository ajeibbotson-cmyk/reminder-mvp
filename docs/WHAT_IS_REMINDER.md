# What is Reminder?

Reminder is an automated invoice chasing platform that helps small businesses get paid faster.

## The Problem We Solve

Small businesses waste hours every week manually chasing late payments. Here's what that looks like:

**Without Reminder:**
- Monday morning: Open Excel, find overdue invoices
- Write individual emails: "Hi John, just following up on invoice #1234..."
- Attach invoice PDF to each email
- Send manually, one by one
- Track responses in spreadsheet
- Repeat next week for invoices still unpaid
- **Time spent: 2-3 hours per session**

This is tedious, error-prone, and takes time away from running the actual business.

## How Reminder Works

**Step 1: Upload Your Invoices (2 minutes)**
- Drag and drop PDF invoices → AI extracts all the data automatically
- Or upload a CSV/Excel file → bulk import hundreds at once
- No manual data entry, no forms to fill out

**Step 2: We Chase Automatically**
- Invoices are organized into time-based "buckets" (1 week overdue, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, etc.)
- Each bucket sends professional reminder emails automatically
- Week 1: Gentle reminder ("Just checking in...")
- Week 2: Follow-up ("Wanted to follow up...")
- Week 3: Firmer reminder ("This is now 3 weeks overdue...")
- Week 4+: Final notice ("Immediate attention required...")

**Step 3: Get Paid Faster**
- When customer pays, mark it in Reminder
- Reminders stop automatically
- See which customers pay on time and which don't
- **Time spent: 10 minutes instead of 2+ hours**

## Who Is Reminder For?

**Small to Medium Businesses** with these characteristics:
- Send invoices to customers (B2B or B2B2C)
- Have payment terms (Net 30, Net 60, etc.)
- Spend time manually chasing late payments
- Want to get paid faster without being pushy

**Typical Users:**
- Trading companies with seasonal invoices
- Service providers with monthly recurring invoices
- Distributors managing multiple customer accounts
- Any business that invoices customers and waits for payment

**Size:** Businesses with AED 500K - AED 5M annual revenue (roughly 50-500 invoices per year)

## What Reminder Is NOT

Reminder doesn't create invoices or do accounting. You already have tools for that:

- **Not QuickBooks** - We don't create invoices, you do
- **Not Xero** - We don't manage your books
- **Not an accounting system** - We just chase what you're already owed

Think of Reminder as the missing piece between creating an invoice and getting paid.

## Why Reminder Exists

In the UAE and Middle East, businesses face specific challenges:
- Payment terms are longer (often 60-90 days)
- Cash flow delays are common
- Manual follow-up is the norm
- Cultural sensitivity matters in communication

Reminder respects business customs while automating the repetitive work. Emails go out during UAE business hours (Sunday-Thursday, 9 AM - 6 PM), use professional templates, and maintain the right tone.

## The Value

**Time Saved:** 2+ hours per week → 10 minutes
**Faster Payment:** Reduce average payment time by 25-40%
**Less Stress:** No more spreadsheets, forgotten follow-ups, or awkward phone calls
**Better Cash Flow:** Get paid consistently, predict income better

## Real Example: POP Trading Company

POP Trading sends ~400 invoices per season across multiple currencies (AED, EUR, USD).

**Before Reminder:**
- Excel spreadsheet tracking
- Manual email writing (2.5 hours every Monday)
- Inconsistent follow-ups
- Payment delays averaging 45+ days

**With Reminder:**
- Upload CSV file once (5 minutes)
- Automatic reminders to all customers
- Consistent follow-up every week
- Expected: Payment time reduced to 30-35 days

## Bottom Line

If you send invoices and wait for customers to pay, Reminder automates the annoying part (chasing) so you can focus on the important part (running your business).

**Upload invoices. We chase. You get paid.**

Simple as that.
