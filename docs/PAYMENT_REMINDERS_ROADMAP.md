# Customer-Consolidated Payment Reminders - Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for customer-consolidated payment reminders in SendAChaser, designed specifically for the UAE market. The feature will reduce email volume by 70%+ while maintaining professional customer relationships through intelligent invoice grouping and culturally-appropriate communication.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure Strengths
- **Email System**: Robust OAuth integration with Gmail/Outlook APIs
- **Contact Management**: Comprehensive contact system with custom fields support
- **Campaign System**: Proven bulk email service with rate limiting (50 emails/day)
- **Template Engine**: Dynamic merge tag system with personalization
- **Analytics**: React Query + Recharts analytics foundation

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Edge Functions)
- **Email**: OAuth APIs with automatic token refresh
- **State Management**: React Query + React Context
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI primitives

## Business Requirements

### Core Problem
Customers with multiple outstanding invoices receive numerous individual reminder emails, creating:
- Email fatigue and potential relationship damage
- Inefficient collection processes
- Unprofessional communication patterns
- Poor customer experience

### Solution: Customer Consolidation
- **Single email per customer** regardless of invoice count
- **7-day minimum** between follow-up emails to same customer
- **Professional templates** with complete invoice overview
- **Cultural sensitivity** for UAE business customs

## Implementation Plan - 4 Sprint Approach

### üöÄ Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2): Foundation - 13 Story Points
**Goal**: Establish data foundation for invoice tracking

#### Database Schema Implementation
- Create Supabase migrations for new tables
- Add RLS policies for multi-tenant security
- Create performance indexes
- Add enum types for status tracking

#### New Tables:
```sql
-- Invoice tracking with customer relationships
invoices (id, user_id, contact_id, invoice_number, amount, currency,
         issue_date, due_date, status, payment_terms, created_at, updated_at)

-- Payment reminder automation
reminder_schedules (id, user_id, name, trigger_days, consolidate_by_customer,
                   min_days_between_reminders, template_id, is_active, created_at)

-- Customer-level reminder history
customer_reminders (id, user_id, contact_id, schedule_id, invoice_ids,
                   total_amount, sent_at, email_status, opened_at, responded_at)
```

#### Service Layer Foundation
- `InvoiceService` - CRUD operations following existing patterns
- `ReminderService` - Automation and scheduling logic
- Zod validation schemas for type safety
- Unit tests for core business logic

**Risk Level**: Medium (Database schema changes)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4): Core Logic - 21 Story Points
**Goal**: Build customer grouping and automated reminder system

#### Customer Consolidation Engine
```typescript
class ReminderConsolidationService {
  async getCustomersNeedingReminders(): Promise<CustomerReminderGroup[]>
  async consolidateInvoicesByCustomer(overdueInvoices: Invoice[]): Promise<ConsolidatedReminder[]>
  async canContactCustomer(contactId: string, minDaysBetween: number): Promise<boolean>
  async scheduleConsolidatedReminder(reminder: ConsolidatedReminder): Promise<void>
}
```

#### Automation Features
- Daily cron job checking due dates
- Customer grouping with 7-day contact rules
- Prioritized queue with escalation logic
- Integration with existing email rate limiting

#### Template System Enhancement
- Consolidated reminder templates for multiple invoices
- Arabic language support for UAE market
- Professional business communication tone
- Merge tags: `{{invoice_list}}`, `{{total_amount}}`, `{{oldest_days}}`

**Risk Level**: High (Complex business logic)

---

### üé® Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6): User Interface - 18 Story Points
**Goal**: Create intuitive UI for invoice management and reminder oversight

#### Invoice Management Interface
```
src/pages/invoices/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ InvoicesPage.tsx           # Main invoice listing
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CreateInvoicePage.tsx      # New invoice form
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EditInvoicePage.tsx        # Edit existing invoice
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ImportInvoicesPage.tsx     # CSV import interface
```

#### Reminder Dashboard & Queue
```
src/pages/reminders/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ReminderDashboard.tsx      # Main dashboard with queue
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ReminderSchedules.tsx      # Automation configuration
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ReminderHistory.tsx        # Communication history
```

#### Integration Points
- Extend existing `DashboardLayout.tsx` navigation
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistency
- Integrate with current analytics using Recharts
- Follow established form validation patterns

**Risk Level**: Medium (UI complexity)

### üîß Sprint 4 (Weeks 7-8): Polish & Advanced Features - 16 Story Points
**Goal**: Complete MVP with professional features and edge case handling

#### PDF Generation & Attachments
- Professional invoice PDF generation using jsPDF
- UAE business standard formatting
- Automatic PDF attachment to reminder emails
- Consolidated statement generation for multiple invoices

#### Advanced Email Features
- Email open/click tracking integration
- Smart send timing optimization for UAE market
- Template A/B testing capabilities
- Progressive escalation workflows

#### Analytics & Reporting

- Collection KPI monitoring (DSO, collection rate)

#### Edge Case Handling
- Partial payment management
- Disputed invoice exclusion
- Multi-currency support (AED, USD, EUR)
- Payment portal integration links

**Risk Level**: Medium (PDF generation complexity)

## Technical Architecture

### Database Performance Optimizations
```sql
-- Critical indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_invoices_customer_due ON invoices(contact_id, due_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_reminders_customer_date ON customer_reminders(contact_id, sent_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_invoices_status_overdue ON invoices(status) WHERE status = 'overdue';

-- Materialized view for reminder queue
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW customer_reminder_queue AS
SELECT
  c.id as customer_id,
  c.name, c.email,
  COUNT(i.id) as overdue_count,
  SUM(i.amount) as total_overdue,
  MAX(i.days_overdue) as max_days_overdue,
  MAX(cr.sent_at) as last_contact_date
FROM contacts c
JOIN invoices i ON c.id = i.contact_id
LEFT JOIN customer_reminders cr ON c.id = cr.contact_id
WHERE i.status = 'overdue'
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.email;
```

### Service Integration Patterns
- Extend existing `BulkEmailService` with reminder campaigns
- Use React Query hooks for state management
- Follow established error handling patterns
- Integrate with current OAuth token management

### Email Rate Limiting Strategy
- Respect existing 50 emails/day quota
- Batch consolidated reminders efficiently
- Queue management for large reminder volumes
- Fallback strategies for quota exhaustion
