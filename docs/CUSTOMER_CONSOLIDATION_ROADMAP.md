# Customer-Consolidated Payment Reminders - Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for customer-consolidated payment reminders in the reminder-mvp application. The feature will reduce email volume by 70%+ while maintaining professional customer relationships through intelligent invoice grouping and culturally-appropriate communication for the UAE market.

## Current System Analysis - reminder-mvp

### Existing Infrastructure Strengths ✅

## Business Problem & Solution

### Current Challenge
UAE businesses experience:

### Consolidation Solution
- **Single email per customer** regardless of invoice count
- **7-day minimum** between follow-up emails to same customer
- **Professional templates** with complete invoice overview
- **Cultural sensitivity** for UAE business customs
- **Total amount prominence** in subject and communication

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Extensions

#### New Table: customer_consolidated_reminders
```sql
CREATE TABLE customer_consolidated_reminders (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id) NOT NULL,
  company_id UUID REFERENCES companies(id) NOT NULL,
  invoice_ids UUID[] NOT NULL, -- Array of consolidated invoice IDs
  total_amount DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,
  currency VARCHAR(3) DEFAULT 'AED',
  reminder_type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'CONSOLIDATED',
  template_id UUID REFERENCES email_templates(id),
  sent_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  scheduled_for TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  last_contact_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  consolidation_reason TEXT, -- Why these invoices were grouped
  priority_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0, -- Based on oldest invoice
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_consolidated_customer ON customer_consolidated_reminders(customer_id, sent_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_consolidated_company ON customer_consolidated_reminders(company_id, sent_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_consolidated_priority ON customer_consolidated_reminders(priority_score DESC, scheduled_for);
```

#### Extended: email_logs table
```sql
-- Add consolidation support to existing email_logs
ALTER TABLE email_logs ADD COLUMN consolidated_reminder_id UUID REFERENCES customer_consolidated_reminders(id);
ALTER TABLE email_logs ADD COLUMN invoice_count INTEGER DEFAULT 1;
ALTER TABLE email_logs ADD COLUMN consolidation_savings DECIMAL(5,2); -- Percentage of emails saved

CREATE INDEX idx_email_logs_consolidated ON email_logs(consolidated_reminder_id);
```

### Service Layer Architecture

#### Core Consolidation Service
```typescript
// New service: customer-consolidation-service.ts
export class CustomerConsolidationService {
  async getCustomersNeedingConsolidatedReminders(companyId: string): Promise<ConsolidatedReminderGroup[]>
  async canContactCustomer(customerId: string, minDaysBetween: number = 7): Promise<boolean>
  async consolidateInvoicesByCustomer(overdueInvoices: Invoice[]): Promise<ConsolidatedReminder[]>
  async scheduleConsolidatedReminder(consolidation: ConsolidatedReminder): Promise<void>
  async trackConsolidationEffectiveness(reminderId: string): Promise<ConsolidationMetrics>
}
```

#### Email Service Extensions
```typescript
// Enhanced: email-scheduling-service.ts
export interface ConsolidatedEmailOptions extends SchedulingOptions {
  invoiceIds: string[]
  consolidationId: string
  totalAmount: number
  attachMultiplePDFs: boolean
}

export async function scheduleConsolidatedEmail(options: ConsolidatedEmailOptions): Promise<ScheduledEmail>
```
