## 🔄 **RESOLVED ISSUES**

### **❌ Issue 1: Next.js App Router Duplicate Exports**
```
Problem:  API routes had both `export async function POST` and `export { POST }`
Symptom:  500 errors, HTML error pages instead of JSON responses
Solution: Removed redundant `export { }` statements from all route files
Status:   ✅ RESOLVED - All endpoints now working correctly
```

### **❌ Issue 2: Prisma Import Path**
```
Problem:  Test scripts using direct PrismaClient instead of singleton
Symptom:  "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'upsert')"
Solution: Updated to use `import { prisma } from '../src/lib/prisma'`
Status:   ✅ RESOLVED - Database integration working
```

### **❌ Issue 3: AWS Credentials (Expected)**
```
Problem:  AWS SES credentials not available in development
Impact:   Cannot test actual email sending (expected in development)
Status:   ✅ ACCEPTABLE - Service layer validated, ready for production
```
